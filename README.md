# WinLauncher
lmao

Prob my first C# project, comming from Java and C++

This is such a bloated mess
It works tho
Kinda

It needs a server of course to function, but this really just has to be a simple http server that
sends a gzip compressed file over the interweb to our little 'installer'

Big fun

Please spare ur soul a chronic disease from looking at this and turn around now
